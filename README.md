## Why did we develop this API ?

This API was the pinacle of our bootcamp. We were asked to develop a full app with frontend and backend as a end of study project. The frontend was developed separately from the backend.
The goal of this project was to provide a way for people to experience the home-sitting.
As a matter of fact, all similar websites are only oriented to retired people. We wanted to open this type of experience to a larger group and let responsible young people to be able to enjoy this type of holidays.

### What services are we proposing

#### Main features

- **User creation and edit** : Create your profile and edit it as you want.
- **Add a house profile with photos**: Create your house profile, and find a home-sitter to keep your house.
- **Add animals and plants** : Create a profile to your animals or plants that you want home-sitter to take care of.

## Setup

Clone the repository to your local computer. Install node modules, install databases, create cloudinary account.

With https:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrSnakeDoc/oparadis.git
cd oparadis
yarn
```

With ssh:

```bash

First you need to have two database local or remote.

For local with docker:

```bash

```

Then you need to fill your .env file with environment variables.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

You will need to create an account on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) and take the cloud_name, api_key, and api_secret and add it to the .env file.

Then you can :
